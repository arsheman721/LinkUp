A social media app that I am developing with Group 17. This was our core module in which we had to make a andriod app of any sort. 

We had to make this App as a team with members assigned with different tasks and role. over all the project is still on going with changes still being made. 

Our app idea was to make a social/ tool that all student could use in brunel to help navigate around the campus and as well get updates on University events. 

As we knew the university made a similar app but failed because of technical issues, we used this to help make a better version with more feature for students to use.
